# HawkV0 keyboard
The HawkV02 (Hardware revision 0, firmware revision 2) is my first keyboard design. It is a 56 key fully wireless split keyboard (4x6 + 4 thumb keys for each half), made to use nice!nano microcontrollers (or clones). The PCB is flippable, so you just need two of the same PCB to have a full split keyboard.

The repository is under construction! 

## Ergogen and PCB files:
The ergogen configuration can be found in "ergogen/config_HawkV0_prod.yaml", the required footprint files in "ergogen/footprints". The ergogen output can be found in "ergogen/HawkV0_output_prod", and in the handrouted PCB can be found in "ergogen/HawkV0_output_prod/pcbs/KeyboardV0.kicad_pcb". I think the "ergogen/HawkV0_output_prod/pcbs/KeyboardV0_gerbes.zip" file should be ready to upload to a PCB manufacturer, I used jlcpcb.com with good results.

This repository is a fork of the bug54 repository by ogruendel, because I want to start with a working ZMK configuration and modify it to my needs. Big thanks to ogruendel for making it all availible!
