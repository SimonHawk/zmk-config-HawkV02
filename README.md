# HawkV0 keyboard
The HawkV02 (Hardware revision 0, firmware revision 2) is my first keyboard design. It is a 56 key fully wireless split keyboard (4x6 + 4 thumb keys for each half), made to use nice!nano microcontrollers (or clones). 

The repository is under construction! I hope to add more documentation of the physical keyboard layout, ergogen config and PCB files in the future, but for now, what you see is what you get.

This repository is a fork of the bug54 repository by ogruendel, because I want to start with a working ZMK configuration and modify it to my needs. Big thanks to ogruendel for making it all availible!
